====Four In A Row Tic Tac Toe

Just a small app to learn angularfire (http://angularfire.com)

You will find both the coffee and js versions of the scripts here, so use whichever you prefer.

To get it going:

1. Create an account at firebase.com, if you haven't already.

2. Copy defaults.coffee.sample to defaults.coffee or defaults.js.sample to defaults.js

3. Change the FIREBASE_URL in that file to your firebase url.

4. Serve the directory structure with your favorite web server. On my mac, I just 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'

5. You should be able to access the server from 2 browsers, each choose a color, and then play 4 in a row tic-tac-toe.

6. The app doesn't have a lot of error checking, so you can cheat. That wasn't really my goal with this. It also doesn't
yet tell you when someone wins. I'll probably work on that later.
